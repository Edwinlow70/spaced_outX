Repository for EZ's works, hopefully...

Hi, my name is Edwin Low.
In gaming world, I'm known as EZ which stands for Edwin Zidane.

I am new to Github, so still trying to figure out.
At the moment, I am taking an AI course with IBM.

Maybe I will have the chance to collaborate with others. 
So hoping for the best!
